DATABASE-DESIGN-MODELLING

Database Modelling is the process of creating a logical and structural representation of a database system.


First step: Write down the purpose of the database and what is it for?

“I want to build a website that tracks the books I have read, the books I want to read, and the books I am currently reading. I want to leave ratings and reviews on these books and see reviews that other people have left on these books.”

Second step : Come up with a first draft of the database tables we may need.

Tables derived from the purpose:


1. Books

2. Ratings

3. Reviews

4. People

Third Step : Add the columns to each of these tables, using the attributes of each table listed above .

Fourth steps : Add referential integrity”, or by add primary keys to each table and foreign keys to tables.
